### Hello!

I'm Debaditya Bhattacharya! I'm third year undergraduate student studying at the Indian Institute of Techonolgy, Kanpur. Although I am pursing BS Physics, my intersts are quite varied. I'm often seen meddling in electronics, neuroscience, biology, computer science and programming!

See you around sometime!
